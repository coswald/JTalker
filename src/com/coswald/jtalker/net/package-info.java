/**
 * <p>Utilizes java socket programming for use with the JTalker application.
 * This package defines and constructs objects with which JTalker can use to 
 * talk between a server and a client. It also includes some utility classes
 * that only certain net packages would use (so there would be little point
 * separating them into a different package). This package is the main
 * backbone to the JTalker application; a lot of the software depends on this
 * package and it's classes to work smoothly.</p>
